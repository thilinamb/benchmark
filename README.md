# benchmark
A set of stream processing use cases implemented for benchmarking between different systems.

Currently implemented streaming uses cases include: 
 - [Query 1 of DEBS 2012](http://www.csw.inf.fu-berlin.de/debs2012/grandchallenge.html) 

These use cases are implemented using [Apache Storm](https://storm.apache.org) and [Granules](http://granules.cs.colostate.edu). We are planning to implementations from other systems in future.
